tube, and better textures for water pump. Re-cut all of the large 
stone/sandstone/etc bricks to make their patterns the same as the 
default textures. Got rid of all the specular maps since they're not 
being used. Re-generated ALL of the normalmaps that hadn't already been

there where the result looked better. Also, deleted redundant 16px 
homedecor and mesecons images, and 32px homedecor door images.

extension. fixed. Also, "unknown block" -> "unknown node"

2013-05-30: Reduced size of most PNG files with pngcrush.  Ran all jpgs through 
jpegoptim (strip all comment/exif data, lossless optimize).  Ran all texture 
.png images through pngquant to convert to 256 colors. Effectively lossy 
compression, which Makes them far smaller, but without any appreciable quality 
loss. Does not affect normal/specular maps, which need to be lossless.

for homedecor kitchen sink.  Delete extraneous homedecor projection screen 
normalmap, add specular map for same.  Fixed screwed up normalmaps for

possible.

layer to stained glass....after three tries to get it right!

2013-04-27: Improved the appearance of homedecor "fancy exterior door", added 
subtle alpha translucency to the glass insert for use later (already made sure 
it looks right with non-alpha-capable clients).

2013-04-26: New textures for stained glass, in keeping with recent changes to 
the default ones.

2013-04-24: Redid default and moreblocks glasses to use thicker borders, 
brought moreblocks support up to date. Lightened, lowered saturation on 
moreblocks iron stone bricks. Fixed recently-broken textures for homedecor 
glowlight sides.  Rename all flowers-mod images to comply with latest changes 
to that mod. Should work for the flowers version that is coming to 'common' 
soon.

2013-04-22: Fixed vertical wire caps.  Added default snow and ice, default 
sandstone and desert stone brick, default coal block, improved default stone 
brick greatly.  Right after: Replaced sandstone with a better one, redid

Fixed textures for mesecons pistons, major improvements to appearance too.  
Fixed insulated wire textures also.

2013-04-20: New splash footer - takes celeron55's name out, replaces it with an 
inspirational phrase, adds a resolution indicator.  Shrunk heart.png to 20px 
(19px heart with 1x1 px empty border) to comply with Lua HUD code, used same 
image in all resolutions. Got rid of half-heart.png since it was never used. 
Greatly improved appearance of some of the fences, added high-rez textures for 
the new corner ones and for the ones I missed before. Still need to do doors 
et.al. Renamed unknown_block.png -> unknown_node.png.

fences/sticks).  Made default wood and steel doors entirely png instead of 
mixed png/jpg.

images, retouched a few more.  Also, added some heavy blur to the poptart cat 
rainbow to make it blend better with its background, scaled and exported the

Fixed.

2012-12-29: Added UV-mapped side textures for moreblocks checkers and 
plankstone.

2012-12-24: Added new image for old default:mese object, since the 'block' 
image got repurposed.

2012-12-17: Added support for my mese changes patch (pending merge to 
minetest_game git master); previous mese object image is now used only for mese 
block, so users of this texture pack will see the old black-on-yellow mese in 
the ground if you don't have my patch against minetest_game.  Added a nice menu 
splash image (320x256 for all resolutions).

2012-12-03: Added support for default steel door, brought homedecor support 
fully up-to-date.

2012-12-02: Added support for Gloopores v1.1

2012-10-15: Added support for water in khonkhortisan's animated fluids mod

now for white and yellow.  Added textures for ceiling-mounted glow cube and 
terracotta base for homedecor.

2012-10-01: Brought support for Homedecor up-to-date with the stuff I've been 
adding over the past week.

2012-09-29: Added support for Jordach's old TV mod (since some of the original

Redcrab's version of timber mod.  Also added support for Xpanes.

can piss off. ;-)

textures to fit revised receiver object).

2012-08-28: Brought pipeworks up to date and added support for tubes (this mod 
only needs 128px and larger images).  Fixed messed-up particles in 256 and 
below sizes. Added appropriate textures for mesecons receiver object. Brought 
mesecons microcontroller images up-to-date and fixed a couple of minor image 
quality issues therein.  Better wield hand image.  Oops, no it wasn't - it 
looked weird the first time.  Really looks better now.

2012-08-25: got rid of outdated unobtaium images - they've been repurposed.

2012-08-20: Huge update in texture packs!  Everything that can be represented 
as a JPG image without a visible quality loss has been converted to that 
format.  That's basically everything that doesn't have an alpha channel.  A few 
images in the 512px set have been adjusted in size by virtue of my realizing 
they could be done better (e.g. Unknown block was too big, while throwing bow 
was too small).  All inventory items have been re-checked to make sure the 
under-512px sizes get the right images.

2012-08-13: New default sapling texture (does not affect that used for some 
mods).  Brought mesecons support up to date with the new nodebox-based stuff 
(this causes some loss of support for the 0.5 series.  Sorry about that.).

2012-08-10: Completed adding support for signs mod (files renamed, re- 
rendered, added as needed), added support for yard signs.

2012-08-09: Added experimental support for xyz's signs mod - sign texture 
itself only; the text can't be improved yet.

2012-08-06: Added seaweed for flowers mod.  A bit later: Reworked the new 
texture so that it's partially transparent and tiles properly.  This 
necessitated making it look a bit "larger" also, but it works anyway :-)

2012-08-05: Fixed wrong filenames on pipeworks images (result of a change I 
made to the actual mod)

2012-08-01: Added geranium flower.

2012-08-01: Brought UnifiedBricks support up to date.

2012-07-31 (continuing): Water has to have an alpha channel and be partly 
transparent or stuff behind it will show up in front, like clouds.

2012-07-31 (continuing): Added support for conifers mod.

2012-07-31 (a while later): Brought support for Vessels mod up to date.

2012-07-31: Improved wood texture a bit more, made it look more like planks 
instead of smooth wood.

2012-07-28: Fixed incorrectly-drawn left/right textures for a few homedecor 
blocks, in keeping with having fixed the references therein.

2012-07-26: Brought Unified Dyes support up to date, added support for Vessels 
mod.  Discontinued support for old Madblocks modpack - it's way out of date.  
Still have the images, I'll push them back up later with new names to account 
for Mauvebic's recent changes.

2012-07-19: Added support for my colored woods mod, improved appearance of 
active furnace.

2012-07-17: Added experimental support for wowiamdiamonds' Unified Bricks mod.

run on the unifieddyes textures.

2012-07-16: Brought support for unifieddyes up-to-date (now 89 colors).

2012-07-14: Added support for Jordach's older 16-color wool mod.

2012-07-08 (immediately after): Added support for my junglegrass mod.  Tweaked 
rotation and position of default jungle grass to center it better.

2012-07-08: Brought support for unifieddyes up-to-date.

2012-07-07 (immediately after): Didn't like the tint I left on clay/clay lump.  
Reduced both to greyscale in keeping with the game's normal style.

2012-07-07: Recolored clay, gravel, and stone to look more like the colors used 
in the default textures, reworked coal, iron, and all moreores minerals to use 
transparency so they can composite properly on top of the stone.  Tweaked 
active furnace to look hotter, fixed wrong filenames, retired 'cooking' 
variant.

2012-06-30: Shifted torch on ceiling (both static and animated), so that base 
of torch is actually centered.  Created new default door imagery in the general 
style of the game's default texture (but still photorealistic of course).  
Renamed the previous wood-and-glass door imagery for use by my homedecor mod.

2012-06-26: Updated various homedecor dye filenames to accommodate the 
changeover to unifieddyes.

2012-06-23: Brought homedecor support up to date.

2012-06-17: Added support for longer crack/digging animations (now 16 frames 
instead of 5), and preliminary support for animated torches, as found in the 
latest git.

2012-06-16 (much later): Enhanced the lava texture, added support for animated 
lava featured in latest git.

2012-06-16 (a bit later): Fixed accidental mirroring of 'folding' doors.

2012-06-16: Added support for my homedecor mod. Adjusted color of default_wood 
to look more like what might be used on a floor or deck and to differentiate it 
from the wood table tops in homedecor (which use the original color). Reduced 
all inventory images in defaults and in all mods to max 64px. Re-rendered 
wooden door and all fence inventory images to max 64px also (most were 32px).

2012-06-14: Brought Blox support up to date.

2012-06-03: Fixed a few missing images, added working image for ecube's 
unobtanium mod, added missing blue dye for blox mod. Added support for blox and 
bobblocks mods in C64 pack, brought C64 version up to date re: moreblocks.

2012-05-30: Reworked various moreores minerals, default and moreores ingots, 
and a few of the lumps and blocks (shiner, more accurate colors, etc.).  
Lightened up and re-colored menubg image significantly.  Improved embossing on 
larger versions of mese.  Tinted iron apple slightly red-brownish (to suggest 
oxidation/rust).  Reworked grass side a bit to improve blending between grass 
and dirt.  Tweaked color and embossing on sandstone.  Fixed stray pixels and 
missed cuts on default swords.  Reworked fireplace wield/inventory image.  
Fixed stray pixels on larger sizes of flower pot (copy&paste error).  Tweaked 
larger sizes of mesecons 'on' torches (center should have been whited out).

2012-05-29: Added support for Bobblocks and Blox mods, brought moreores, 
moreblocks, and maptools support up to date.  Tweaked 32 px maptools admin 
pick, added a few missing 16px maptools textures.  Tweaked default rails to 
better differentiate them from moreores copper rails.  Updated filename for 
current hatches mod (now just hatch.png).

2012-05-27: Added support for maptools, deleted furnace_furnace_* images (for a 
patch that will never happen), renamed some of them and created new ones to add 
support for darkrose's active furnaces patch (which *does* exist).  Split all 
texture packs into separate github repositories.

2012-05-16 (even later): deleted github repo and created a new one with 
multiple branches.

2012-05-16 (a bit later): added a few more colors to complete wool mod support.  
Updated github repo (didn't go through properly last time).

2012-05-16: Fixed a few stray pixels in the pies, scorched stuff and a few 
tools, cleaned up edges of cotton, cotton-in-pot, and cotton (ball), fixed 
slight slight lack of color saturation on chest top, added some shading to 
chest sides to make handles stand out better, reduced noise in dirt, grass+dirt 
side, and alien grass+dirt side, reworked mese, faded the color a bit on the 
paper, broke the repetitive look of the papyrus/bamboo, replaced tin and silver 
lumps with better images (actually derived from platinum and osmium), added 
support for wool mod.  Updated screenshots.

2012-05-06: Added support for my poison ivy mod.

2012-05-01: Created 32px and 128px versions.  Fixed a few stray pixels that 
snuck in while resizing some images earlier.  Reduced all fence and door images 
meant for the inventory display to max 32x32 (anything more is overkill).  
Reworked 16px door inventory image slightly.  Reworked other door images as 
well to fix scaling errors.  Reworked mesecons wall lever and wall button and 
wireless devices to improve overall appearance.  Reworked 512px "chicken" sign 
and all 256px and smaller signs to fix edge quality.  Reduced menubg to max 
128x128px.  Reduced treeprop to max 128x128 pixels (both are always displayed 
small, both lower in <128px packs).  Re-introduced 16 px pack - just gotta have 
it; it's a bit more complete than before, but still lacks Madblocks Infra, 
signs, and hydroponics mods.  Reworked unknown block/object/item images.

2012-04-29 (almost immediately): Fixed a few missing 64px and 256px images and 
image credits files.

2012-04-29: Reworked bushes/strawberry "tree" a bit, renamed a bunch of files 
and added a few more to bring Madblocks up to date (also adds good support for 
power lines/utilities).  Retired the 16px texture pack from distribution - it 
just isn't good enough.

2012-04-26 (a bit later): Removed Tron flowers from regular distribution 
(they're no longer used but I'll keep them locally just in case). Replaced 
previous-removed hydroponics images with better ones that won't make you itch. 
;-)

2012-04-26: Deleted all vine-like images related to the hydroponics mod.  I 
accidentally used a base plant that is most definitely NOT suitable for eating 
- poison ivy!  Will replace the missing images shortly.

2012-04-25 (a bit later): Reduced menu background image in 512px pack to 
256x256 (it's always displayed at 128x128 pixels, so this still provides some 
future-proofing).  Reduced half heart to 32x32 in 64/256/512px packs to match 
full heart.  Added support for particles mod (64px and up only, all images are 
49x49px in all cases).

2012-04-25: reworked moreblocks/rope to look more like the sort of swinging 
vines/ropes seen in movies and such (left the ones for the vines modpack 
alone).  Renamed a few files and added a bunch more to add support for 
hydroponics mod (64px and above only).

2012-04-24: reworked all magic lantern images in all packs; on a revisit, I 
decided that the dithering to simulate translucency just doesn't work, so I 
undid the dithering and flattened them all against a dim yellow background.  
Fixed an alpha error that snuck in while making the nether "portal stuff" 
object, reduced 64px and 512px hearts to 32 px each since they'll likely never 
need to be be drawn any larger than that anyway (or probably over 16x16 for 
that matter).  Created a complete 256px version of the pack.

2012-04-22 (even later): Duplicate default_furnace_front.png to a different 
filename for use by the active furnaces mod.

2012-04-22 (a bit later): Replaced active/cooking furnace with a set of images 
to add support for lkjoel's active furnaces mod (WIP).

2012-04-22: Tweaked 16px furnace a bit.  Added images for half heart and 
active/cooking furnace.

2012-04-21: Reworked moreores/gold ore, added support for nether mod.  
Re-uploaded with 16px support for nether (same filename)

2012-04-20 (a bit later): Reworked cooked rat (too many copy&paste artifacts).  
Added support for spotlights mod.

2012-04-20: Reworked default_brick slightly, fixed outdated filenames on 
moreores/mithril ore and cooked rat, reconfigured, renamed, and added a whole 
bunch of textures to bring pack up to date with transition from Moreblocks-OCD 
to Madblocks: this update adds support for all mods in that set, except only 
partial support for infrastructure mod (only the "street builder" object, 64px 
and larger sizes only), and signs mod (64px and up only; 16px is just too low 
of a resolution to retain enough detail).  Tweaked 16px default glass to match 
the various similar glow glass objects.

2012-04-15 (even later): Brightened up and reworked railroad tracks to improve 
quality and tiling.  Reworked all mesecons wires and objects bearing them to 
improve tiling.  Neither category of images was rendered symmetrically, so they 
tiled weird at some rotations.  Updated relevant screenshot.

2012-04-15 (a bit later): reworked default and cherry blossom trees (and tops)

tree. ;-) Also updated the screenshots.
