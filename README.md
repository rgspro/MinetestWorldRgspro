My Minetest World and Texture pack files used for creating my video series


Welcome to the MinetestWorldRgspro wiki!

The following world files are for the Minetest game version 0.4.16

Here are the files for my Minetest world. You can see the entire world on my video series on Youtube https://www.youtube.com/c/RichardJeffries

The files contain the world files and texture pack

******* The "map.sqlite.zip" must be downloaded from the files separetly from the main download.  The file is stored differently because of its size.  I am working on a solution for this. ************

Basic instructions for use.

Download the zip file from the repository

Go into the world folder on the code page to download and unzip the "map.sqlite.zip" file

**The map.sqlite.zip file in the downloaded world zip file is just a pointer to the large file storage LFS file and has to be downloaded separetly. **

Unzip the downloaded zip file

Go into the texture pack folder and copy the folder "rgs1" to your Minetest Textures folder

Copy the World folder to your Minetest Worlds folder

The following mods are used and will cause the map to show "Unknown object" if the mod is missing
